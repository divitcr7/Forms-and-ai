## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid using `any` type - be specific with types
- Export types/interfaces that are used across files

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing styling patterns
- Ensure responsive design
- Support both light and dark modes

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:

```
feat: Add form duplication feature
fix: Resolve form submission validation issue
docs: Update README with new API endpoints
style: Format code according to style guide
refactor: Simplify form state management
